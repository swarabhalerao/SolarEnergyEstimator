# SolarEnergyEstimator
First ever hackathon submission and first ever attempt at making a GUI application.
The biggest challenge was:
Webscraping for personalising the results using IP address and location and then looking up the statistics about the location from online aggregators while keeping API requests minimum were the biggest hurdles and took a lot of time. We tried multiple API but either the data was severly outdated or it had a limit to API requests. We ended up using a website that changes URL according to the location and scoured the .json file to filter out the relevant data.
On the GUI front, the pop up windows took a lot of attempts to get right given the fact that we are new to Tkinter and have no idea what the syntax is supposed to be.
